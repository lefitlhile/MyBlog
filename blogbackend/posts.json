Suffering is optional.” — Haruki Murakami\nMurakami’s words serve as a powerful reminder that while pain is a part of life, how I respond to it is within my control.

You just have to stop letting them control you.” — Dan Millman\nThis quote resonates with me deeply on days when anxiety and negative thoughts spiral out of control.
